## Notes and Observations
What I learned about Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is that, although it requires work to understand and use, the gains you make in the future are much greater than the effort needed to learn.
IaC changes unpredictable, tedious manual deployment into systems that are automated and reliable.
Automating infrastructure with code allows teams to deploy with less effort, reduce risks, work more efficiently and document everything more correctly.
With these tools e.g. terraform, you don't need a single sysadmin to hold up progress which means people can deploy for themselves and teams can share ideas.

IaC brings the benefits of software engineering to solutions used in infrastructure management.
Thanks to version control, automated testing, code reviews and the usage of modules, results in better quality and an easier way to trace code development and deployment.
Developers and sysadmins enjoy a better work environment, as they get to focus on innovation and smart automation, rather than constantly doing the same thing over and over.
Seeing all these benefits made it evident to me that investing in Terraform is useful, even when it involves studying languages and frameworks I don't know.
Since we put emphasis on how much better these tools would make things in the long run, it became easier for everyone to overcome the initial learning curve.
